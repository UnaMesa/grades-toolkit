        Dear Superintendent:
        </p>

        <p>
          I am writing from the Department for Children and Families to request that {{name}}, who came into state custody 
          on {{dateOfCustody}}, maintain school placement at {{BID.schoolToAttend}}. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The child has moved to the home of {{MOU.resourceFamilyName}} at {{MOU.resourceFamilyAddress}}. 
        </p>
        <p>
          {{#if MOU.mothersName}}
            This child’s mother, {{MOU.mothersName}}, lives in {{MOU.mothersTown}}. <br/>
          {{/if}}
          {{#if MOU.fathersName}}
            This child’s father, {{MOU.fathersName}}, lives in {{MOU.fathersTown}}.
          {{/if}}
        </p>
        <p>
          Attached is a copy of the Best Interest Determination Evaluation Form that has been completed by input from this student’s team. This document and attachments outline the student’s educational needs and why those needs can be best met by the student remaining in their current school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
